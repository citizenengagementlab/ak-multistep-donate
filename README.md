ak-multistep-donate - a boilerplate for developing multistep donation forms using Actionkit

Dependencies:

* Actionkit templating environment.

How to use:

* Copy templates to appropriate templates in AK templateset.
* Update static paths to match /path/to/donate.js + /path/to/donate.css (warning: this will probably not look very good right out of the box)

Things that would be cool:

* Implement in Angular or some other component-based framework so you can do something like <donate-form></donate-form>
* Decouple JS from specific DOM elements so that it is easy to just instantiate the donate form a container element.
* Create generic bootstrap form styles for boilerplate build.
